<h2>Settings</h2>
<p>
The widgets that you can add to the dashboard have settings to customize them.
When you are in edit mode, all the widgets will have a small gear icon on the top right corner.
Click on the gear and choose &quot;Edit&quot; to open the settings for the widget. 
The settings panel consist in most cases of three parts:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><b>Description:&nbsp;</b>A short description of the widget and how to use it.</li>
	<li><b>Widget Settings:&nbsp;</b>The settings which are specific to this type of the widget. For some widgets there are no settings and this part will not be available.</li>
	<li><b>Widget Default Settings:&nbsp;</b>The settings that are common and shared by all of the widgets.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here an example of the settings panel for a Label Widget:</p>

	<li><b>Add Links:&nbsp;</b> Use the Label Widget to add links to other applications. By changing the widgets color, you can make it look like a button.</li>
	<li><b>Adding Custom HTML:&nbsp;</b> Administrators with the permission "Allow HTML" and/or "Allow Javascript", can add custom HTML/Javascript to the title/footer field to add custom content to the widgets.
